#Comments
#Box Model: Provide a legend of some kind to demonstrate what variables represent more clearly

#Lotka-Volterra Additional Questions
#Formatting could be more professional - heading and subsections rather than numbered and lettered points
#Models are well-made and clear
#Utilizing a table is a nice touch

#Lotka-Volterra.py
#Code looks great, and plots are identical to ours. We're either on the right track, or both wrong.

#Paradox of Enrichment
#Variable labels are clear and well-organized

#Project Plan
#Project doesn't have any cool people working on it

#Rosenzweig-MacArthur.py
#Too many pound signs in Rosenzweig-MacArthur plot. Hashtags aren't cool.

#Additional Comments:
#Well put-together project with reasonable conclusions and clear explanations. Well done!
